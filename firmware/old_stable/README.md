# OLD-stable-store

## Version 0.15.3 based on Gluon 2021.1.2

** --> PLEASE use this firmware-branch ONLY if you don't find your router-firmware in "stable"-branch!!!!**

For more detailed informations please read release-notes: https://gluon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/v2021.1.2.html

Many smaller hardware-devices are not supported in future gluon- and OpenWRT-versions anymore. Please don't buy or install any of those now unsupported routers. Keeping those devices online might also become a security risk for your network as firmware-bugs will never get fixed on those devices in the future.

Please consider to replace all of your EOL-devices bit by bit if possible.
